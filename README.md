# README #

This README documents whatever steps are necessary to get project up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is contains the latest source code, along with some other stuff like timely screenshots of the UNDONE engine, which is primarily another game engine, but that is not decided yet, what the engine can do might change in the future. The engine is currently only compatible with the Windows operating system, but it is designed in a way so that all system specific code is nicely abstracted away under its own little place, and to port it into other operating systems is fairly easy to do.

Some features that have been successfully implimented untill now are:

The engine is able to access the graphics hardware to use fully accelerated hardware.

It can load 3d models of many supported and widely used formats such as obj, collada, blend, 3ds, maya and more!

Can load up all major,y available image formats.

Has a component based architecture which makes using the engine easy.

A customized memory management module.
